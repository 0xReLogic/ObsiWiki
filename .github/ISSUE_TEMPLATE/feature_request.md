### Is your feature request related to a problem?
Please describe the problem you're trying to solve.
*Example: It's currently difficult to handle image syntax that includes size parameters, like `![[image.png|100]]`.*

---

### Describe the Solution You'd Like
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
*Example: The script should parse the `|100` part of the image link and convert it to a GitHub-compatible `width="100"` HTML attribute.*

### Technical Implementation Ideas
(Optional) If you have ideas on how to implement this, please share them. This could include:
- **Regex patterns**: A potential regex pattern to match the new syntax.
- **Logic changes**: Which part of the code might need to be modified.
- **Edge cases**: Things to look out for (e.g., what if there's no size parameter?).

### Expected Outcomes
What are the benefits of implementing this feature?
- ✅ Users will be able to control image sizes directly from Obsidian.
- ✅ The transformation will be more robust and cover more of Obsidian's syntax.
- ✅ It will reduce the need for manual HTML edits after the script runs.
